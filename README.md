# Tamil Nadu Weather Prediction 🌡️

A machine learning-powered weather prediction system for major cities in Tamil Nadu, India. This application uses historical weather data and current conditions to predict tomorrow's temperature.

## Features

- Real-time weather data from Open-Meteo API
- Machine learning-based temperature predictions
- Interactive web interface with Streamlit
- Support for major Tamil Nadu cities:
  - Chennai
  - Coimbatore
  - Madurai
  - Tiruchirappalli
  - Salem
- Historical temperature trends and visualization
- Prediction history tracking

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The app will automatically open in your default web browser. If it doesn't, navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

## How it Works

The application:
1. Fetches current weather data for the selected city using the Open-Meteo API
2. Retrieves historical weather data for the past 7 days
3. Uses a Linear Regression model to predict tomorrow's temperature
4. Displays the prediction along with historical trends and previous predictions
